# Bit of War

Online massive multiplayer war game, over BTC blockchain:

My pleasure to announce the first public version of Bit of War. A real time massive multiplayer war game fully connected to the blockchain!

Try the last version of the game at: https://www.bitofwar.com

You'll need a few BTC in order to play it!

#Rules are quite simple!

- Each time you kill an enemy, you'll earn 100 bits.
- Each time an enemy kills you, you'll lose 100 bits.

At that point you'll need to respawn, but no worry!
Respawns are cheap, and come with a limit of 5 powerups that you can use during the battle.
Use them wisely will certainly give you gains!

#Gambling Warning

- Bit of war can be illegal in certain countries.
- Bit of War is considered a Game of skill, not a Game of chance, hence we believe it's not gambling.
- Bit of War is not a Game of chance, nor a casino.
- Players play for BTC.

A game of skill is a game where the outcome is determined mainly by mental or physical skill, rather than by chance. Some commonly played games of skill include: poker...

Bit of War has been evaluated several times proving that better players (which have better aim, and better game strategies) do real gains in the long run game. I believe it's equally important to mention as well that worst players will incur into losses.

A multiplayer real time action challenge connected to the bitcoin network. No luck involved, the better you aim, the faster you move, the more chances you have!

#Uses Segwit

Thanks to the speed and efficiency provided by bitcoin switness and Green Addresses, the whole action is recorded for ever on the blockchain, as it happens. Bit of war is an online real time strategy game, connected to the bitcoin network.
